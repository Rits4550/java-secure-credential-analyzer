# Secure Credential Analyzer (Java)

## Overview
A Java-based console application that evaluates password strength and identifies basic security risks using clean Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design.

## Features
- Password length validation
- Complexity analysis (uppercase, lowercase, digits)
- Detection of commonly used weak passwords
- Modular and extensible architecture

## Tech Stack
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Collections Framework

## OOP Concepts Used
- Abstraction (interfaces)
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Separation of concerns (service-based design)

## What I Learned
- Designing extensible Java applications using interfaces and services
- Applying security-aware thinking to real-world problems
- Debugging package, class, and build issues in Java projects
- Setting up professional Java project structure with `src` as source root

## How to Run
```bash
javac src/checker/*.java src/model/*.java src/service/*.java src/Main.java
java -cp src Main
